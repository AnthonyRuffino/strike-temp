# strike-temp
JavaScript module for calculating the strike temp of beer

Strike Water Temperature Tw = (.2/r)(T2 - T1) + T2
where:
r = The ratio of water to grain in quarts per pound.
T1 = The initial temperature (Farenheit) of the mash.
T2 = The target temperature (Farenheit) of the mash.
Tw = The actual temperature (Farenheit) of the infusion water.
